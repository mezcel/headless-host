* The ```pkgdownload``` script is from [https://github.com/yusuphwickama/wickerscripts]( https://github.com/yusuphwickama/wickerscripts )
* The ```make_installer_script.sh``` will extract the zip file denerated by ```pkgdownload```, and generate a separate installer script.
    * The installer script is cumbersome for large dependency packages like Xorg.
