## win10-notes

notes for:

* configuring Notepad ++ for gcc/g++ compilation

    * requires: [MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/)

* configuring VS Code for C/C++ compilation

    * requires: [Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Build Tools](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [C++ extension: VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
    * It is a large setup, but still less bloated and easier to config than the Full VS Studio

* vim for win10 notes and paths
